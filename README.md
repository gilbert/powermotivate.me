# PowerMotivate.me

The source code for [powermotivate.me](http://www.powermotivate.me)

This project makes use of and gives much credit to:

- [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/)
- [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) & [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/)
- [Raphael-svg-import](https://github.com/wout/raphael-svg-import)
- [Backbone.localStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)

## TODO list

- Remove jQuery dependency (it's only used in `src/js/app.js`)
- Redraw upon window resize (yeah I'm lazy)
- Probably a "today" button somewhere
- Ability to change title to whatever subject the user wants
- Export / import data
- Allow multiple markoff calendars (probably would need some ui thought)

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. If you plan to build something that's not on the TODO list, discuss your ideas with me first, just in case. I'm open to new ideas.
